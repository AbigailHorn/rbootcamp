# R Bootcamp for Scientific Computing <img src="fig/trojan-rlogo.svg" width="150px" align="right">


**Website**: https://github.com/USCbiostats/rbootcamp

This boot camp has as main goal to give a general overview of scientific
computing, and in particular, on the R programming language. It is
divided in 5 days. The first three days will be a mix of presentations
and hands-on work, and the last two will be 100% hands-on where the
attendees are expected to work on [**a short project**](projects/) and present their
results at the end of the boot camp.

## Dates

The bootcamp will take place on the week of Monday August 13th, 2018:

| **Lecture 2** | Tuesday, August 14, 10 AM to 2 PM | SSB 116|
| **Lecture 3** | Wednesday, August 15, 10 AM to 2 PM | SSB 116|
| **Hackathon** (*after student orientation*) | Thursday, August 16, 2:30 PM to 5:30 PM | SSB 116|
| **Final Presentations** | Friday, August 17, 10 AM to 1 PM | SSB 114|
