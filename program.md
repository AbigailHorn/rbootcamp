This boot camp has as main goal to give a general overview of scientific
computing, and in particular, on the R programming language. It is
divided in 5 days. The first four days will be a mix of presentations
and hands-on work, and the last day will be primarily hands-on where the
attendees are expected to work on [**a short project**](projects/) and present their
results at the end of the boot camp.
