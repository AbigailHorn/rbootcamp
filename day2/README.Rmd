# Data types 


*   The most basic data (object) type in R are vectors.
    
    ```{r}
    myvec1 <- vector("logical", 3)  # This is a logical vector of length 3
    myvec2 <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE) # This is ALSO a logical vector of length 3
    myvec2
    length(myvec2)
    ```
      

*   Vectors can be of different modes: `logical`, `integer`, `numeric` (double), `complex`, `character`, and `raw`.
    (so one mode per vector!).
    
*   Vectors can also be lists, which is a VERY special type of object in R (most of its objects are lists!)
    ```{r}
    mylist1 <- vector("list", 2) # This is a list with 2 empty slots
    mylist2 <- list(NULL, NULL)  # This is ALSO a list with 2 empty slots
    mylist1
    ```

----

*   Moreover, lists elements can have names
    
    ```{r}
    mylist2 <- list(first = NULL, second = 1, third = c("a", "b", "c"))
    mylist2
    ```
    
    And we can access them as follows
    
    ```r
    # Getting the 3rd element of the list
    mylist2$third      # By name using the dollar sign
    mylist2[[3]]       # By position
    mylist2[["third"]] # By name using a string
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    mylist2[["third"]]
    ```


# Attributes and Structure

*   Objects in R have attributes (metadata)

    ```{r}
    # Here are the attributes of the iris dataset
    attributes(iris)    
    ```

    ```{r}
    head(iris)
    ```
    

----

*   You can take a general look at the structure of an R object with the `str()` function
    ```{r}
    # Let's take a look at the iris dataset, again
    str(iris)
    ```

# Missing values {.small}

R has different types of Missing values:

-   `NA`: no information, has length 1,
-   `NULL`: which has length 0,
-   `Inf`: Infinite, and
-   `NaN`: Not a Number
        
```{r missings, collapse=TRUE}
str(c(NA, 1L))        # Integers can have NAs
str(c(NaN, 1L, Inf))  # But not NaN or Inf (automatic coercion)
str(c(-Inf, 1, NULL, +Inf)) # And Nulls are... of length 0!
```

*   In the second line, we have an example of *automatic coercion*

*   These have companion functions `is.na()`, `is.null`, `is.infinite` (or `is.finite()`, which covers NA, Inf, and NaN), and `is.nan`.

# Questions

1.  What is the mode of the following vector `myvector <- c(NA, NaN, Inf)`? (try not to use the `mode()` function in R)

2.  The `c()` function can be used with other vectors, for example

    ```{r}
    my_integer_vector <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)    
    my_string_vector  <- c("hello", "world")
    ```
    
    What is the mode of the vector `c(my_integer_vector, my_string_vector)`?
    
3.  What do each one of these functions return on the vector `myvector`?

    ```{r testing-is, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
    is.na(myvector)
    is.infinite(myvector)
    is.finite(myvector)
    is.nan(myvector)
    ```

4.    What are the attributes of the following object `mymat <- matrix(runif(12), ncol=4)`?

# Linear Algebra

*   **Matrix**: A special class of array, are vectors with a `dim` attribute of length 2 (number of rows and number of columns).
    
    ```{r}
    mymat <- matrix(1:9, ncol=3) # A matrix with numbers 1 through 9 with 3 columns
    mymat
    str(mymat)
    ```
    
    R stores elements in column major-order. We can access matrices elements in the following way.
    
    ```{r, collapse=TRUE}
    mymat[1, 2] # The element in the (1, 2) location of the matrix
    mymat[4]    # The fourth element in the vector... which is (1, 2)
    ```
    
    Matrices can have row and column names too.
  
----

*   Some matrix fundamental operators, for matrices `A`, and `B` (both square) with the same dimensions (just for the examples):

    *   Element wise product, addition, substraction, and quotient: `A * B`, `A + B`, `A - B`, `A/B`
    *   Transpose `t(A)`.
    *   Inverse `solve(A)`.
    *   Column and row bind, `cbind(A, B)`, `rbind(A, B)`.
    *   Matrix product between both `A %\*% B`.
    

# Questions

*   Given the following matrices `A`, `B`, and C
    
    ```{r, R.options=list(digits=2)}
    set.seed(122)
    A <- matrix(rnorm(12), ncol=3)
    B <- matrix(rnorm(12), nrow=3)
    C <- A %*% cbind(1:3) + rnorm(4) # Adding a vector of length 4!
    ```
    
    Compute
    
    1.  Compute the matrix product between `A` and `B`
    2.  Generate the transpose of `A`
    3.  Merge `A` and `B` by row and by column. 
    3.  Calculate the element-wise product of `A` and the transpose of `B`.
    4.  Calculate The inverse of the cross product of `A`, this is $(A^\mbox{t}\times A)^{-1}$
    5.  Compute $(A^\mbox{t} A)^{-1} A^\mbox{t} C$. How could you do this with a single command in R?
  

    ```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
    # Matrix multiplication:
    A %*% B

    # Transpose
    t(A)
    
    # Element-wise product
    A*t(B)

    # Inverse
    solve(t(A) %*% A)
    
    # OLS
    solve(t(A) %*% A) %*% t(A) %*% C
    ```

# Statistical Functions

*   R has a very nice set of families of distributions. In general, distribution functions have the following name structure:
    
    a.  **Random Number Generation**: `r[name-of-the-distribution]`, e.g. `rnorm` for normal, `runif` for uniform.
    
    b.  **Density function**: `d[name-of-the-distribution]`, e.g. `dnorm` for normal, `dunif` for uniform.
    
    c.  **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**: `p[name-of-the-distribution]`, e.g. `pnorm` for normal, `punif` for uniform.
    
    d.  **Inverse of the CDF (quantile)**: `q[name-of-the-distribution]`, e.g. `qnorm` for the normal, `qunif` for the uniform.
    
*   In the case of [**pseudo random numbers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator){target="_blank"} (the `r` prefix), it is important to **always** set the seed to ensure **reproducibility**

    ```{r setseed, collapse=TRUE}
    # First run
    set.seed(12)
    rnorm(4)
    
    # Second run
    set.seed(12)
    rnorm(4)
    ```
    
    More distributions available at `??Distributions`.

---

*   Take a look at the normal distribution

```{r}
set.seed(12)
op <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
hist(rnorm(1e5))
curve(qnorm)
curve(pnorm, xlim=c(-3, 3))
curve(dnorm, xlim=c(-3, 3))
par(op)
```

---

*   Take a look at the exponential

```{r}
set.seed(12)
op <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
hist(rexp(1e5))
curve(qexp)
curve(pexp, xlim=c(0, 6))
curve(dexp, xlim=c(0, 6))
par(op)
```

# Questions

1.  Draw 1e5 samples from a chi2 with 2 degrees of freedom (hint: check `?Distributions`).

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
set.seed(778)
Z1 <- rchisq(1e5, 2)
# hist(Z1, breaks=100)
```
    

2.  Draw 1e5 samples from a chi2 with 2 degrees of freedom using `rnorm`, to do this, execute the following steps:
    
    1.  Draw 2 standard normal vectors of length 1e5,
    2.  Compute the squared version of each vector, now each will be distributed chi2 with 1 degree of freedom,
    3.  Sum the 2 vectors, that will be a chi2 with 2 degrees of freedom.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
set.seed(778)
Z2 <- rnorm(1e5)^2 + rnorm(1e5)^2
# hist(Z2, breaks=100)
```

    
3.  To make sure you are getting the (approximately) same solution in both, compute the probability of obtaining values less than 2 using the CDF (cumulative distribution function, a.k.a, probability function) of the chi2 distribution, and compare that value with the following approximation $\frac{1}{n}\sum_i \mathbf{1}(X < 2)$ on the results you obtained in parts 1 and 2.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
pchisq(2, 2)
mean(Z1 < 2)
mean(Z2 < 2)
```

*   The hyperbolic discount problem: In simple words, people overvalue the present (which yields regret in the future!)

*   Online tools for projecting retirement savings are usually very optimistic (sorry!), like yielding a 5\% fix average return (no bond gives you that!)

*   We will perform some simulation models using real data and, instead of obtaining a point estimate of our future savings, we will obtain confidence intervals (a range of possible outcomes).


# Steps to follow

1.  Read in the data set [HistoricalPrices.csv](HistoricalPrices.csv){target="_blank"}from returns from the stocks market.

2.  Create a function that simulates a random return trejectory by sampling from the stocks market.

3.  Mix all in a for-loop function that creates a random pension savings trajectory.

4.  Wrap it around 1,000 simulation, and plot the output using the `boxplot` function in R.


# About the dataset

*   Dow Jones Industrial Average (downloaded from https://quotes.wsj.com/index/DJIA/historical-prices)
    
    -   This dataset covers from 1990 to 2018
    -   It provides the prices at the daily
    
    ```{r}
    # Loading the R package
    library(readr)
    
    # Reading the data
    dow <- read_csv(
      "HistoricalPrices.csv",
      # We can tell the function how the data is stored
      col_types = cols(Date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"))
      )
    ```
    
---

Let's print it out 

```{r dow-print}
dow
```

---

Taking a look at it

```{r dow-plot}
plot(x = dow$Date, y = dow$Close, type="l")
```

---
    
# Keeping the monthly data only

```{r}
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
dow_monthly <- dow %>%
  filter(months(Date) != months(lag(Date))) %>% # Keeping the last day of the month
  arrange(Date) %>%                             # Sorting by date
  mutate(
    r = Close/lag(Close) - 1                    # Computing the monthly return
  ) %$%
  r[-1]                                         # Keeping all, but the last month   
```

# About the model

$$
S_t = S_{t-1}\times(1 + r_t) + I_t\times c_t
$$

Where $S_t$ is your savings balance in time $t$, $r_t\sim R$ is the return rate in time $t$, $I_t$ is your income in time $t$, and $c_t$ is your contribution rate in time $t$.

# Functional Programming

```{r dow-function}
sample_dow <- function(n=100) {
  sample(dow_monthly, n, replace = TRUE)
}
```

Creating the core function


```{r savings-sim} 
#' @param n_nomths Integer, number of months to simulate.
#' @param S0 Initial balance of savings.
#' @param I0 Income.
#' @param c_rate Monthly contribution rate
sim_savings <- function(
  n_months = 200,
  S0       = 0,
  I0       = 40/12,
  c_rate   = .05
) {
  
  # Generating returns
  R <- sample_dow(n_months)
  S <- vector("numeric", n_months)
  
  # First value
  S[1] <- S0
  
  for (i in 2:n_months) 
    S[i] <- S[i - 1]*(1 + R[i - 1]) + I0*c_rate
  
  return(S)
  
}

plot(sim_savings(200), type="l")
```

# Simulations

Running multiple simulations using the `replicate` function.

```{r multiple-simulations}
set.seed(1)
nsim    <- 1e4
nmonths <- 12*30

ans02 <- replicate(nsim, sim_savings(nmonths, c_rate = 0.025))
ans05 <- replicate(nsim, sim_savings(nmonths, c_rate = 0.05))
ans10 <- replicate(nsim, sim_savings(nmonths, c_rate = 0.10))
ans15 <- replicate(nsim, sim_savings(nmonths, c_rate = 0.15))

```

# Analyzing the results

Stacking the last row (period) of each set of simulations using `cbind` 

```{r stacking-the-results}
ans <- cbind(
  "2.5%" = ans02[nmonths,],
  "5%"   = ans05[nmonths,],
  "10%"  = ans10[nmonths,],
  "15%"  = ans15[nmonths,]
  )

# We can look at a few observations with the `head` function
head(ans)
```


# Visualizing the output

```{r plot-ci-def}
plot_CI <- function(x, conf_interval=.95, col="steelblue")  {
  
  # Computing cureves
  lvl <- (1-conf_interval)/2
  lvl <- c(lvl, .5, 1-lvl)
  dat <- t(apply(x, 2, quantile, lvl))
  
  # Emptyplot
  plot(NA,xlim = c(1,nrow(dat)), ylim=c(0, max(dat)))
  
  # Drawing the confidence region
  polygon(
    c(1:nrow(dat), nrow(dat):1),
    c(dat[,1], rev(dat[,3])),
    col    = adjustcolor(col, alpha.f = .5),
    border = "transparent"
  )
  
  # Drawing the 50%
  lines(dat[,2], lwd=2, lty=2, col=col)
  
  # Legend
  legend(
    "topleft",
    col  = c(col, col),
    lty  = c(NA, 2),
    fill = c(col, NA),
    legend = c(
      paste0("%", conf_interval*100, " confidence"),
      "Median"
      )
  )
}
```

---

```{r plot-ci-call}
op <- par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot_CI(t(ans02))
plot_CI(t(ans05))
plot_CI(t(ans10))
plot_CI(t(ans15))
par(op)
```

```r
# Changing the palette
palette(
  adjustcolor(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8, "Set1"), alpha=.7)
  )

# Using a nice-looking boxplot
boxplot(
  ans,
  main = "Distribution of Retirement Savings Balance",
  xlab = "Monthly Savings as a Proportion of Income",
  ylab = "Savings (thousands of USD, log-scale)",
  log  = "y",
  las  = 2,
  col  = 1:4,
  lwd  = 1.5,
  border = 1:4
)
```

```


# Problems

1.  In a lot of cases, more than encouraging people to increase their savings is
to ask them to retire later. Using the code shown here, analyze what are the effects
of postponing retirement 1, 3, and 5 years.

2.  A big assumption we made was having no gaps, this is, always employed and
contributing. To account for this, we can include a poisson process as follows:
    a.  Simulate times at which you become unemployed assuming that on average,
    you will spend half a month unemployed, i.e. a rate of (1/24).
    b.  You can do this using the `rexp` function, e.g.:
    ```{r poisson-process}
    set.seed(1231)
    when_unemployed <- rexp(5, 1/24) # Times at which become unemployed
    when_unemployed <- cumsum(floor(when_unemployed))
    when_unemployed 
    ```
    
    Assume that you spend one month unemployed.

3.
