title: Bootcamp Suggested Projects
output: github_document

The last part of the Bootcamp consists on working on a particular R-programming
project. The idea is that you, either by yourself or with a team, go full hands-on
and apply what you've learned during the Bootcamp.

Here you'll find some examples of projects/problems that you could work on:


```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
# Listing projects
projects <- list.files(no..=TRUE, pattern = "README[.]R?r?md$", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
projects <- projects[grepl("^[.]/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+/README[.]R?r?md$", projects)]

ans <- lapply(projects, function(x) {
  
  # Reading the yaml header
  y <- rmarkdown::yaml_front_matter(x)
  
  for (e in c("title", "description", "keywords", "difficulty", "author"))
    if (!length(y[[e]]))
      y[[e]] <- "-"
  
  # Creating link
  l <- gsub("^[.]/", "", x)
  l <- gsub("README[.]md", "", l)
    
  # Printing for the table
  c(
    as.integer(stringr::str_extract(l, "^[0-9]+")),
    sprintf(
      "[%s](%s)",
      y$title,
      l),
    y$difficulty,
    paste(y$keywords, collapse = ", "),
    y$author)
  })

ans <- do.call(rbind, ans)
colnames(ans) <- c("Proj. \\#","Title", "Difficulty", "Keywords", "Author")
ans <- as.data.frame(ans)
knitr::kable(ans)

```

We encourage you to use **Github** and **R Markdown** to manage and present your
projects.

We will be discussing projects on our [Slack Workspace](https://usc-rbootcamp.slack.com)
(sign in using your @USC.edu email address).
