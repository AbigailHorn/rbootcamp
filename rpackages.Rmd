# Recommended R Packages

R has a thriving development community, and there are now over 12,000 packages on CRAN, the central repository for R packages. Many also exist on GitHub. Here are several we recommend for common analyses. Packages that live on GitHub need to be installed with the `devtools` package. Packages below can be installed from CRAN using `install.packages("package_name")` unless otherwise stated.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```
